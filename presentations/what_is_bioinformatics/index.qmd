__Bioinformatics__: An interdisciplinary field that develops computational methods and software tools to analyze and interpret large, complex biological datasets using biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

## Origin Story {.smaller}
-   __1960s__: Over 10 years before the development of DNA sequencing
-   The Edman degradation method for protein sequencing could only sequence them in small fragments of 50-60 amino acids
-   __Margaret Dayhoff__ and __Robert S. Ledley__ developed the first bioinformatics software, COMPROTEIN to assemble the fragments into the full structure of each protein

## DNA Sequencing
-   __1977__: The first cost effective method of sequencing DNA is developed by __Frederick Sanger__
-   Allowed for ~450 bases of DNA to be sequenced 
-   __1976__: The first fully seqeunced genome (Bacteriophage MS2)
-   __1979__: The first DNA bioinformatics software is developed by __Roger Staden__


## 1980s

-   Parallel advances in biology and computer science
-   __1983__: PCR amplification is invented by __Kary Mullis__
-  __1984__: the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group published the ‘GCG’ software suite for DNA, RNA and protein analysis.
-   Bioinformatic analysis was now possible on personal computers
-   __1985__: Computer Applications in the Biosciences (CABIOS), the first bioinformatics journal is established


## The Human Genome Project

-   __1990__:  Initiated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
-   Cost $2.7 billion in taxpayer money (in 1991 dollars)
-   Completed in 2003
-   Several pioneer software were developed in the mid to late 1990s to assemble the whole-genome sequencing reads


## Next Generation Sequencing {.smaller}

-   __2003__: '454' pyrosequencing and sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technologies were invented, allowing for the sequencing of millions of DNA molecules in a single machine run
-   __2014__: Cost to sequence a human genome drops to $1000

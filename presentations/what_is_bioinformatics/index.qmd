__Bioinformatics__: An interdisciplinary field that develops computational methods and software tools to analyze and interpret, complex biological datasets using biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

## Origin Story {.smaller}
-   __1960s__: Over 10 years before the development of DNA sequencing
-   The Edman degradation method for protein sequencing could only sequence them in small fragments of 50-60 amino acids
-   __Margaret Dayhoff__ and __Robert S. Ledley__ developed the first bioinformatics software, COMPROTEIN to assemble the fragments into the full structure of each protein

## Timeline {.smaller}
-   __1976__: The first fully sequenced genome (Bacteriophage MS2)
-  __1977__: First easy to use personal computers hit the market
-  __1984__: The University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group published the ‘GCG’ software suite for DNA, RNA and protein analysis.
-   __1990__:  Human Genome Project initiated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
-   __2003__: Human Genome Project completed, cost $2.7 billion (in 1991 dollars)
-   __2014__: Cost to sequence a human genome drops to $1000

## Skills Needed

-   Programming languages: R, Python and SQL
-   Computer skills: UNIX command-line, git
-   Domain knowledge: Understanding of molecular genetics, cell biology, evolutionary biology
-   Quantitative skills: Statistics, linear algebra, machine learning
-   Communication skills: Translating complex analyses into insights for researchers

## Questions I Help Answer

-   What genes are differentially expressed between conditions or treatments?
-   Which biological pathways are activated in disease versus healthy samples?
-   Which cell types are present in my single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data?


## Thank you!
